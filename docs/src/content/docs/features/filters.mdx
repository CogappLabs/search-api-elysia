description: Filter search results by string, array, boolean, and range values.

Filters narrow search results to documents matching specific field values. Pass them as a JSON object in the `filters` query parameter on the [search endpoint](../../reference/search/).

## Filter types

### String filter

Match documents where a field equals a specific value:

```bash
curl "https://search-api-elysia-production.up.railway.app/collections/search?q=&filters=%7B%22country%22%3A%22Scotland%22%7D"
```

```json title="filters decoded"
{ "country": "Scotland" }
```

### Array filter

Match documents where a field equals any of the given values (OR logic):

```bash
curl "https://search-api-elysia-production.up.railway.app/collections/search?q=&filters=%7B%22country%22%3A%5B%22Scotland%22%2C%22Wales%22%5D%7D"
```

```json title="filters decoded"
{ "country": ["Scotland", "Wales"] }
```

### Boolean filter

Match documents where a boolean field is `true` or `false`:

```bash
curl "https://search-api-elysia-production.up.railway.app/collections/search?q=&filters=%7B%22hasImage%22%3Atrue%7D"
```

```json title="filters decoded"
{ "hasImage": true }
```

### Range filter

Match documents where a numeric field falls within a range. Both `min` and `max` are optional:

```bash
curl "https://search-api-elysia-production.up.railway.app/collections/search?q=&filters=%7B%22population%22%3A%7B%22min%22%3A10000%2C%22max%22%3A500000%7D%7D"
```

```json title="filters decoded"
{ "population": { "min": 10000, "max": 500000 } }
```

You can use just `min` or just `max` for open-ended ranges:

```json
{ "elevation": { "min": 1000 } }
```

## Combining filters

Multiple filters can be combined in a single object. All filters are applied with AND logic:

```json
{
  "country": "Scotland",
  "hasImage": true,
  "population": { "min": 5000 }
}
```

## Filters and facets

:::note[How post_filter works]
When both `filters` and `facets` are used in the same search request, filters on fields that are also requested as facets are applied as a `post_filter` in Elasticsearch. This means facet counts for those fields reflect the **unfiltered** result set, which is typically what you want for a faceted search UI — users can see how many results exist for other filter values.

Filters on fields that are **not** in the facets list are applied as regular query filters and will affect both the results and all facet counts.

## Facet endpoint limitations

:::caution
The [facets endpoint](../../reference/facets/) only supports string and string array filters. Boolean and range filters are only available on the [search endpoint](../../reference/search/).
