Authentication is entirely optional. When no API key is configured, all endpoints are open. This is fine for internal or development use — add a key when you're ready to restrict access.

## Enabling authentication

Set an API key in one of two ways:

**In `config.yaml`:**

```yaml
apiKey: ${API_KEY}
```

**Or via environment variable only:**

```bash
API_KEY=my-secret-token bun run start
```

If both are set, the config file value takes priority.

## Making authenticated requests

Include the key as a `Bearer` token in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer my-secret-token" \
  http://localhost:3000/my_index/search?q=hello
```

Requests without a valid token receive a `401 Unauthorized` response:

```json
{ "error": "Unauthorized" }
```

## Public endpoints

These endpoints are always accessible, even when authentication is enabled:

| Endpoint       | Description                     |
| -------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `GET /health`  | Health check and cache status   |
| `GET /openapi` | Interactive Swagger UI          |
| `GET /openapi/json` | OpenAPI JSON specification |

<Aside>
If you don't need authentication at all, simply omit `apiKey` from your config and leave `API_KEY` unset. The API will serve all endpoints without any auth checks.
