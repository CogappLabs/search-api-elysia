## Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) v1.0 or later
- An Elasticsearch instance (v7 or v8) with at least one index

## Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

## Configuration

Copy the example config and edit it with your Elasticsearch details:

```bash
cp config.example.yaml config.yaml
```

A minimal config looks like this:

```yaml
port: 3000

indexes:
  my_index:
    engine: elasticsearch
    host: https://localhost:9200
    apiKey: ${ES_API_KEY}
    indexName: my_es_index
```

Each key under `indexes` becomes a URL handle — the config above creates endpoints at `/my_index/search`, `/my_index/autocomplete`, etc.

See the [Configuration guide](/guides/configuration/) for the full reference.

## Running

Start the server:

```bash
# Production
bun run start

# Development (auto-reload on changes)
bun run dev
```

## Verify

Check the health endpoint:

```bash
curl https://search-api-elysia-production.up.railway.app/health
# {"status":"ok","cache":"disabled"}
```

List configured indexes:

```bash
curl https://search-api-elysia-production.up.railway.app/indexes
# {"indexes":[{"handle":"my_index","engine":"elasticsearch"}]}
```

Run a search:

```bash
curl "https://search-api-elysia-production.up.railway.app/my_index/search?q=hello"
```
