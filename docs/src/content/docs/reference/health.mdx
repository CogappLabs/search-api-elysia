```
GET /health
```

Returns the API status and Redis cache connection state. This endpoint is always accessible, even when [authentication](../../guides/authentication/) is enabled.

## Response

```json
{ "status": "ok", "cache": "connected" }
```

| Field    | Type     | Description                          |
| -------- | -------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `status` | `string` | Always `"ok"` when the API is running. |
| `cache`  | `string` | Redis cache state (see below).       |

### Cache states

| Value         | Meaning                                    |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `"connected"` | Redis is configured and connected.         |
| `"error"`     | Redis is configured but the connection failed. |
| `"disabled"`  | No `REDIS_URL` set — caching is off.       |

## Example

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/health
# {"status":"ok","cache":"disabled"}
```
